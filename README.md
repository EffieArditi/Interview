### Suppose you are standing on the summit of Mt. Washington, New Hampshire, USA on Mar-19th, 2018 with a hat on your head. When would be a good time to take it off before it blows away?

To answer this question you will have to use [Climacell](https://climacell.co) [Api](https://developer.climacell.co/docs)
Explore the api to understand which service suits you best.

#### Required solution:
* Create a react app that uses [Climacell Api](https://developer.climacell.co/docs) to get the weather data to decide when a hat might fly off your head.
* Display a graph that shows the weather parameter you are using over time with an indication of when would the hat fly.
* Deploy your solution to a static web hosting service of your choice (such as `Heroku`, `Github`, `AWS S3`, `Netlify` etc..) so it is publicly available.

#### Guidelines:
* Pay attention to SW design and clean code.
* You are free to use any tool / library of your desire.
* We encourage using [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app?files=1).

#### Before you start:
* Create a branch with your name from the `master` branch
* Request for an `apikey` to work with [Climacell Api](https://developer.climacell.co/docs)



Don't hesitate to contact on any question.
#### Good Luck!!!
